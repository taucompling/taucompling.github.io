        <p>
            The Tel Aviv University Computational Linguistics Lab uses computational methods to investigate human language acquisition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Researchers in the lab seek to offer a perspective on learning and learnability that is informed by work in theoretical linguistics, psychology, and computer science and to support collaboration between these fields in addressing a shared research question: what can be learned?
        </p>
        <p>
            The lab's overarching research project is the creation of a fully general model of language acquisition that will allow divergent representations of grammar proposed in the linguistic literature to be evaluated and compared on a computationally and cognitively sound basis.
        </p>
        <p>
			Current projects include research on the acquisition of phonology, using both Optimality Theory and rule-based systems as models, research on the acquisition of mildly context-sensitive grammars in syntax, and a study of the computational advantages and disadvantages of segregating the lexicon from the syntactic component.</p>
        <p>
            The Computational Linguistics Lab is part of the <a href="http://humanities.tau.ac.il/linguistics_eng/">Linguistics Department</a> and the <a href="http://neuroscience-web.tau.ac.il/en/">Sagol School of Neuroscience</a>.
